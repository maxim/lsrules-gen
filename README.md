## Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams ruleset generated from Microsoft's provided endpoints list. Caveat: after I applied these rules, I still had to deal with a couple of additional endpoints, not sure why, but hopefully this eliminates most of the annoying popups without allowing all outgoing connections. Any "optional" endpoints are allowed to avoid too much noise.
